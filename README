First run of the project
========================

These steps are nessecary when you want to work with this project for the first time:

 1. Install [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity)

 2. When using AsReml 3: Copy your asreml.lic file into the project root

 3. If you are behind a proxy server, create a file named `.Renviron`. On 
    Windows, take care that the file doesn't get a `.txt` file extension. Save
	the the needed environment variables. For example, for a HTTP proxy:

        http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:3128"
        https_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:3128"

    If you have another proxy, check the cURL manual to see which environment 
    variables you have to set.
	
 4. To run R in the command line or to run a script, follow the next two 
    sections. To start RStudio Server, which is useful for developing and
    debugging, continue with section "First start of RStudio Server".

Start an R session
==================

Use the script `cexec` to start R. Open a shell, change working directory to
the project folder and type 

    ./cexec R

Execute R scripts
=================

The container for this project includes RStudio as well as bare-bone R. 
Follow the steps in this section if you want to execute R 
without running RStudio. You don't have to do this if you want to run RStudio 
and run an R script from there. 
In RStudio, just use the normal R and Rscript calls. See below on how to prepare
and start RStudio. 
 
Open a shell. You can run R scripts with the help of `./cexec`, that you find 
in the same folder as this README. For example, to run an R script called `example.R`:

    ./cexec Rscript example.R

First start of RStudio Server
=============================

You only have to do this once. You can repeat these steps if you forgot 
your password for RStudio Server:

 1. Open a shell and set the working directory to your project folder 
    
	    cd /path/to/this/folder

 2. Set a password for rstudio-server using 

        ./cexec rstudio-passwd > .rstudio-passwd
    
	
Start RStudio
=============

If you have not done the steps of the previous section "First start of the
RStudio Server", do that prior to these steps.

 1. If not done already, open a shell and change the working directory to your 
    project folder.
 
 2. (Optional but recommended) Start the `screen` program. This way, RStudio can
    stay running when you close your terminal window later.
 
 3. Run `./run-rserver`. A URL is printed to the screen. As long as this 
    program is running, you can access RStudio by typing this URL into your
    browser. 

 4. If you are running screen, to keep RStudio running in the background, 
    detach from the screen session by typing Ctrl+A, D. See a tutorial about
	`screen` in the internet for more information about this.

Multiple parallel instances of RServer Studio
=============================================

Accessing multiple instances of RStudio Server in the same browser leads 
to problems. You might get logged out of one RStudio when you access the other
one. Use Add-ons like 
[Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
to prevent those.
